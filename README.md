# How to build
**Prerequisites**

This editor requires following dependences on Linux-based systems.
Debian and it's derivatives:
```
build-essentials
libasound2-dev
zlib1g-dev
cmake
qt5-default
qttools5-dev
libpulse-dev
libqwt-qt5-dev //OPTIONAL
libjack-dev //OPTIONAL
```
Arch and it's derivatives:
```
desktop-file-utils
hicolor-icon-theme
jack
libpulse
qwt
cmake
qt5-base
qt5-tools
```
Before you start the build, make sure you have also cloned submodules!

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
**Building with CMake**

Navigate to the project directory in a terminal and follow this build procedure.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
make
sudo make install
```

This will result in a software installation located in /usr/local, with program shortcuts, icons and MIME type associations.

**Building with QMake**

The easiest way is to open FMBankEdit.pro in the QtCreator software and run a compilation. Alternatively, you can also build manually on the command line.

Navigate to the project directory in a terminal and follow this build procedure.

```
qmake CONFIG+=release CONFIG-=debug FMBankEdit.pro
make
```
As alternate way you can open FMBankEdit.pro in the Qt Creator and build it.
